    "text": "What is contained in Advent Hymnals?\nThis is an ambitious project, already spanning more than a year. At the end of it, it should be able to achieve the following:\n\nText for all the songs in all hymnals used by Adventist from Millenial Harp of 1843 all the way to the present one.\nTunes for all of these hymns.\nLinks to renditions of these songs if they exist, or to those sang by singing software if human renditions of the same are not available.\nIdentify and make visible all points where there is an error in any of the songs, such as in Millenial Harp where it says of the second advent Gabriel sounds his mighty trumpet. This is part of singing with understanding.\nIdentify all changes that have been introduced in the modern hymnals and the reasons behind those changes.\nAvail all this data in an easy to use mobile phone application.\nAvail also a desktop application for personal use or for projecting in public worship."

Maybe you belong to one of those churches where most people know but a few songs and they never ever want to learn any new one, so that it is the same rounds meeting after meeting. But remember that in your family worship you can sing these. We will continue doing all that we can so as to make learning the songs here so easy that a child uneducated in music can learn them on his own.\nAs you continue singing, you will learn such deep Bible truths that can never be effaced."

When sealing our election \nThy heart did break in woe,\nWith shame and love’s affection, \nThat men should treat Thee so; \nWe know Thy love’s strong fervour \nBy all Thy pain and grief;\nThen hear us, Great Preserver,\nAnd worship now receive."

Thou dost remember still, amid\nThe glories of God’s throne,\nThe sorrows of mortality,\nFor they were once Thine own.\n\n3. Yes, for as if Thou would’st be God,\nE’en in Thy misery,\nThere’s been no sorrow but Thine own \nUntouch’d by sympathy.\n\n4. Jesus, my fainting spirit brings\nIt’s Tearfulness to Thee,\nThine eye at least can penetrate \nThe clouded mystery.\n\n5. And is it not enough, enough,\nThis holy sympathy ?\nThere is no sorrow e’er so deep \nBut I may bring to Thee."

See mercy, mercy from on high,\nDescend to rebels doom’d to die;\n’Tis mercy free, which knows no bound; \nHow sweet, how blessed is the sound'\n\n2. Soon as the reign of sin began,\nThe light of mercy dawn’d on man, \nWhen God announc’d the early news,\n“The woman’s seed Thy head shall bruise.\n\n3. Brightly it beam’d on men forlorn, \nWhen Christ, the holy child was born; \nAnd brighter still in splendour shone, \nWhen Jesus, dying, cried, “’Tis done 1”\n\n4. The work complete when He arose, \nBursting the snares of all His foes, \nWhen captive led captivity,\nAnd took for us His seat on high.\n\n5. Till we around Him then shall throng, \nThis mercy shall be still our song;\nAnd ev’ry scheme shall God confound \nOf all who strive its course to bound!"

Soon on this wretched scene of night \nUnbounded bliss shall rise,\nAnd realms of infinite delight \nShall gladden mortal eyes.\n\n2. There pain and sickness ne’er shall come,\nThere man shall ne’er complain;\nBut all who reach that peaceful home, \nWith Jesus there shall reign.\n\n3. No cloud that region e’er shall know\nFor ever bright and fair;\nFor sin, the source of mortal woe,\nCan never enter there.\n\n4. O may the heav’nly vision fire\nOur hearts with ardent love,\nTill wings of faith and strong desire \nBear ev’ry thought above."

Gloomy and dark the night has been,\nAnd long the way, and dreary,\nAnd sad each faithful saint is seen,\nAnd faint, and worn, and weary.\n\n3. Ye mourning pilgrims! dry your tears,\nAnd hush each sigh of sorrow;\nThe light of that bright morn appears,\nThe long sabbatic morrow.\n\n4. Lift up your heads—behold from far\nA flood of splendour streaming,\nIt is the bright and morning Star,\nIn living lustre beaming.\n\n5. And see that star-like host around\nOf angel-bands attending:\nHark! h ark! the trumpet’s gladd’ning sound \n’Mid shouts triumphant blending."

Let us love the Lord th at bought us,\nPity’d us when enemies;\nCalled us by His grace, and taught us, \nGave us ears, and gave us eyes;\nHe has wash’d us in His blood,\nHe presents our souls to God.\n\n3. Let us sing, though fierce temptation\nThreaten hard to bear us down;\nFor the Lord, our strong salvation, \nHolds in view the conqu’ror’s crown; \nHe Who wash’d us in His blood,\nSafe will bring us home to God.\n\n4. Let us wonder; grace and justice\nJoin, and point to mercy’s store; \nChrist hath died; in Him our tru st is;\nJustice smiles, and asks no m ore;\nHe Who wash’d us in His blood,\nHas secur’d our way to God."

The Father’s changeless love we sing,\nBlest fountain! whence our comforts spring: \nHow great the depth, how high it flows,\nNo saint can tell, no angel knows.\n\n3. Its length and breadth no eye can trace, \nNo thought explore the bounds of grace: \nThe love which sav’d our souls from hell, \nTranscends a seraph’s tongue to tell."
